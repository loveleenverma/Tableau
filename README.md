Whether you're a data analyst, business intelligence professional, or simply interested in fire insurance analytics, this repository offers valuable insights and resources.

## Project Overview

This project is structured into several phases:

1. **Data Generation**: Synthetic data generation mimicking real-world fire insurance scenarios. This step ensures the availability of diverse and realistic datasets for subsequent analysis.

2. **Conceptual and Logical Modeling**: Development of conceptual and logical data models to define the structure and relationships of the fire insurance data. This phase lays the foundation for designing an efficient and effective data warehouse.

3. **Physical Data Warehouse Creation**: Implementation of the physical data warehouse on SQL Server, incorporating the conceptual and logical models. This step involves database design, schema creation, and data loading to establish a robust foundation for analytics.

4. **Tableau Dashboard Creation**: Utilization of the SQL Server data within Tableau for the creation of dynamic and interactive dashboards. These dashboards provide stakeholders with actionable insights, visualization of trends, and performance metrics related to fire insurance.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to each phase of the project:

- **Conceptual and Logical Modeling**: Includes diagrams and documentation outlining the conceptual and logical data models.
- **Physical Warehouse Creation**: Provides SQL scripts and resources for setting up the physical data warehouse on SQL Server.
